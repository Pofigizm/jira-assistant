# Overview
*Jira Assistant* is a Chrome extension that makes interactions with [JIRA](http://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/overview) easier.

And of course makes life better :)

# Features

"Copy Task Title" button is provided for each task page. It allows you to copy task title into the clipboard and use it later as a part of the svn commit message.

# Plans
Just for now it's only feature I need. If you have some propositions, you are free to contact me and ask for them or do a pull request.

# Install
Download [stable version of the extension](https://dl.dropbox.com/s/qx5v6occdnya5cd/jira_assistant.crx?dl=1). And install it via double click.

*Extension is not for public usage right now and could be used only for [SUP Media](http://www.sup.com/en/index.html) JIRA tracking system. But you're free to tune it up yourself (fork and install unpacked). It will be fixed soon.*
