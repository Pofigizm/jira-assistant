# Overview
*Jira Assistant* is a Chrome extension that makes interactions with [JIRA](http://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/overview) easier.

And of course makes life better :)

# Features

"Copy Task Title" button is provided for each task page. It allows you to copy task title into the clipboard and use it later as a part of the svn commit message.

# Plans
Just for now it's only feature I need. If you have some propositions, you are free to contact me and ask for them or do a pull request.

# Install

1. <a href="http://valeriivasin.com/extensions/jira_assistant/jira_assistant.crx" download="jira_assistant.crx">Download</a> the extension to your computer.
2. Click the wrench icon on the browser toolbar.
3. Select Tools > Extensions.
4. Locate the extension file on your computer and drag the file onto the Extensions page.
5. Review the list of permissions in the dialog that appears. If you would like to proceed, click Install.

*Extension is not for public usage right now and could be used only for [SUP Media](http://www.sup.com/en/index.html) JIRA tracking system. But you're free to tune it up yourself (fork and install unpacked). It will be fixed soon.*
